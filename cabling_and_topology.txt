-topology: 
    a topology a discription of how the network is layed out.
       -- physical topology:
            how the computers are layed out.(actual layout)
       -- logical(digital) topology:  
            how the data is being sent between the computers(data flow)

--various topologies: 
    ---the bus topology :(the oldest)
        all the hosts are connected by a centralized single cable.
        and they all share the same bandwidth so as we add host the speed 
        gets slower.

        100mb/s         80mb/s          40mb/s          20mb/s 
        ------          -------         -------        -------
       | host1 | ----> | host2 | ----> | host3 | ---> | host4 |
        ------          -------         -------        -------

    ---the Ring Topology:(outdated)
        frames will travel around the ring.

            |host 1|    
           /         \
          /           \
         /             \
     |host6|          |host2|
          \              \
           \              \
            \              \
          |host5|       |host3|
              \          /
               \        / 
                \      / 
                |host4| 

    ---The Star(hub-and-spoke) topology:(common topology)
        multipul hosts connect to a centralized single box(switch, not hub ..)
        and the box determines to which and how the network frames will be sent to the hosts


                            |host1|     |host2|      |host3|
                                 \        |           /
                                  \       |          /
                                   \      |         /
                                -------------------
                                |                 |
                                |  box(switch,..) |
                                |                 |
                                -------------------

    --- The hybrid topologies:
        the combination of topologies above. for example the star-bus topology

    *NOTE: the hub is considerd as a bus topology, so if a networks useed a hub
    the physical for may look like a star but it's actually a bus.

    ---the mesh topology:
        all the hosts are connected to each other.
        the advantage is that if one goes out the stream of date won't be distrupted.(fault tolerance)

        the mesh topology while might not be really practical on for a wired network situation
        but it's really useful and handy for wireless situations 




-coaxial cable:
-twisted par cable:
    they're twisted so they can reduce Electromagnetic Interference(EMI) 
    --unshielded twisted pair(utp): != stp== shielded twisted pair
        --four or more pairs of cable
        ---max distance:100m (325ft)
        ---connector: RJ-45
        ---standards: TIA/EIA-568A , TIA/EIA-568B

    --UTP Category Rating(CAT):

Category	Standard Bandwidth	    Max Data Rate	     Shielding
Cat5e	    100MHz (up to 350)	      1000Mbps	        UTP or STP
Cat6	    250MHz (up to 550)	      1000Mbps	        UTP or STP
Cat6A	    500MHz (up to 550)	      10Gbps	        UTP or STP
Cat7	    600MHz	                  10Gbps	        Shielded only
Cat8	    2000MHz	                  25Gbps or 40Gbps	Shielded only 

-fiber optic cable: 
        all of them have two connectors on each side(duplex)
        one carries the light away and one brings the light to the card.

    --multimode cable: carries LED signals
    --single-mode cable: carries laser signals- sutable more for far distances

    --connectors: 
    ST connector
    SC connector 
    FC connector(dont confuse with ST)
    LC connector
    MT_RJ connector

    NOTE: 
        if you want to connect two fiber optic cable together, you have to polish them first.
        different types of polishing:
            UPC(ultra physical contact)
            APC(angled physical contact) 7 degree angle 


-fire rating for cables:
